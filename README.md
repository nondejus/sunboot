sunboot
-------

sunboot makes it easy to get an operating system running on Sun hardware. This is the sister project to a similar utility for Silicon Graphics computers called [irixboot](https://github.com/halfmanhalftaco/irixboot).

## <a name="howitworks"></a>How it works

Sun hardware was designed with the network in mind and nearly every Sun machine I've come across has baked-in support for booting from Ethernet devices. The code in PROM knows enough to be able to initialize the ethernet adapter and send a broadcast request for its IP address via RARP. Once the machine has its IP address it sends a request via TFTP (UDP port 69) to the address that replied to RARP for a file whose name is the hexadecimal representation of the IP address. This file is the bootloader (often called 'boot' or 'inetboot') and is loaded into RAM and executed.

The bootloader program knows how to use RPC to call BOOTPARAMS and retrieve information about which filesystems to mount via NFS. It contains enough code to download the kernel via NFS. Control is then passed over to the kernel which then brings the system up the rest of the way.

Later hardware supports the more modern DHCP for booting but most machines can fall back to RARP/TFTP.

## <a name="features"></a>Features

- Simple configuration
- Supports multiple simultaneous clients running different OS versions
- Diskless-client install & autoconfiguration
- Remote install for diskful-client systems
    - Emulates remote tape and CD-ROM devices as install sources
    - Supports netbooting the miniroot environment for formatting local disks and running the installer
- Supports both SunOS and Solaris (diskless support for Solaris is in the works)
- Boots (probably) any RARP/TFTP/BOOTPARAMS/NFS capable Sun workstation and operating system 

This project is in its early stages so right now it only supports the following:

- Only SunOS 4.1.4 (Solaris 1.1.2) and Solaris 2.3 have been tested at this point.
- CD-based operating systems (SunOS 4.1.x, Solaris)
- Diskful (remote install) and Diskless support for SunOS 4.1.x
- Diskful (remote install) support for Solaris

### Planned features

- Diskless Solaris installs
- Tape-based SunOS installs (including pre-SPARC systems)
- Non-Sun OS support (netbsd, Linux)
- Centralized user/group/host management (yp/NIS/NIS+)
- Support for installing sunboot on other non-x86 systems (Raspberry Pi, etc.)

---

## <a name="requirements"></a> Requirements

- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

Hardware-wise, any virtualization-capable Intel-based computer should work. VirtualBox and Vagrant support Linux, MacOS and Windows.

---

## <a name="configuration"></a>Configuration

sunboot has configuration distributed in a few locations. To fully configure sunboot, the following will need to be edited to suit your environment:

- [Vagrantfile](#vagrantfile)
- [sunboot-settings](#sunboot-settings)
- [targets directory](#config_targets)

### <a name="vagrantfile"></a> Vagrantfile

First, the `Vagrantfile` has one item that needs to be configured: the bridge interface. sunboot must be bridged to (not NAT-ed) to the network where the Sun machine(s) are connected. This is to support the broadcast traffic required to bring these machines up. Fill in your network interface name (can be determined with `VBoxManage list bridgedifs`, the `Name` is the field it looks for). In this example, `eth1` is the interface to be bridged. If this is not filled out, Vagrant will ask at startup which interface to use.

```ruby
  config.vm.network "public_network", auto_config: false, bridge: "eth1"
```

### <a name="sunboot-settings"></a> sunboot-settings

The next configuration step is the server configuration. This contains the hostname, IP address, netmask and gateway of the server. This should be chosen to not interfere with existing machines on the bridged network and be outside of any DHCP address ranges that may be present on the network.

```bash
# General environment settings

SERVERNAME=sunboot
SERVERADDR=10.94.42.7
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
GATEWAY=10.94.42.1
```

### <a name="config_targets"></a> targets directory

Files in this directory specify the settings for individual machines to enable netbooting for.

Example:

```bash
# SPARCstation IPC SunOS 4.1.4 Diskless Install Example

TARGETARCH=sun4c
TARGETNAME=hobbes
TARGETETHER=8:0:20:a:7d:8f
TARGETADDR=10.94.42.208
TARGETSWAPSIZE=64

# options: DISKLESS or DISKFUL
INSTALLMETHOD=DISKLESS

# options: CDROM or TAPE
INSTALLMEDIA=CDROM

# path (within 'sunos' directory) to the install CD-ROM or directory that contains 'tape1', 'tape2', etc. dirs
INSTALLMEDIAPATH=solaris1.1.2.iso
```

`TARGETARCH` should be set to the correct kernel architecture required for your machine.

Examples:

- Sun-2 machines are always `sun2`
- Sun-3 machines are either `sun3` or later 68030-based machines are `sun3x`
- Early SPARC machines are `sun4`, while SPARCstation 1-era machines are `sun4c`. Machines based on the multiprocessor-capable architecture (SPARCstation 10, 20 and relatives) are `sun4m`.
  - There are some fairly esoteric derivatives of these such as `sun4d`, `sun4e`, `sun4u1` and `sun4us`
- UltraSPARC I, II, III and IV machines are `sun4u`
- UltraSPARC T1 and later are `sun4v`

`TARGETSWAPSIZE` is the size of the swapfile allocated to the machine, in megabytes. A general rule of thumb is RAM * 2.

A `DISKFUL` install will configure the machine to boot into the installer for the operating system media provided. For SunOS 4.1.x this will boot the machine into `miniroot` and boot to a shell where one can run `format` to label local disks and then `suninstall` to perform an installation. For Solaris this will boot into the graphical installer if a keyboard is present.

A `DISKLESS` install tries to emulate a full install of the operating system. Currently this is only supported for SunOS 4.1.x. All of the available software sets are extracted to disk and exported via NFS. The operating system is customized per the target configuration to set the IP address and hostname.

Install media should be placed in the provided `sunos` directory. Paths specified in `INSTALLMEDIAPATH` are relative to this directory.

---

## <a name="security"></a>Security

sunboot configures the virtual machine in a way that is inherently insecure. The boot process was designed in an era where the network was considered fully trusted so security on the modern Linux-based operating system that sunboot uses must be bypassed in several cases to make things work.

It is recommended to airgap or at minimum heavily firewall the network that sunboot is configured on.

- `rsh` is enabled and allows passwordless root login to SunOS diskful installs. This is required to support remote media access.
- read-write NFS exports are restricted by IP address only, there is no other authentication in place which means other machines on the network could potentially access NFS on these exports as root or any other user without restriction. Static ARP entries are entered on the sunboot VM to mitigate.

The sunboot VM does require internet access during `vagrant up` in order to download the required Debian packages. After the initial configuration is complete it can be disconnected from the internet.

### <a name="sunos_ipc"></a> Diskless SunOS 4.1.4 on a SPARCstation IPC

At this stage the server is now ready to boot the target machine. From the target machine, all that should be required is a `boot net` command. The following is the output from the serial console:

## Maintenance

Since sunboot supports diskless clients you probably don't want to be destroying/recreating the VM very often. There's a couple commands built in that help add new clients and remove old ones.

To run these commands you'll need to log into the Vagrant VM with `vagrant ssh`.

### Commands

- `sudo target_rm <target_name>`
   - This will remove all of the install artifacts for the given target, including its NFS exports, root filesystem, etc. It does *not* remove the target configuration file or the generic miniroot/exec/protoroot environment for the target's operating system.
   - This is particularly recommended for SunOS diskful targets after the OS has been installed to disable root rsh capability to the boot server.
- `sudo install_targets`
    - Run this command to reprocess all the target files in the `targets` directory. It skips any targets that already have root filesystems in place (in `/export/root/<targethostname>`)
- `sudo mount_media <target_name>`
    - When multiple machines are configured for diskful installs, the correct install media may not be ready for the client. Run this to ensure that the appropriate media for this target is configured.
